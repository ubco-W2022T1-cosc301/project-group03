# COSC 301 - Final Project Group 3 - Milestone 5 
###### *Note: Analysis was to be done for 3 questions but project was reduced to two members*

## Introduction

This project focuses on the importance of group-think in affecting the behavioral outcomes of fans within NFL stadiums. To understand this metric, we utilize NFL arrest data from (2011-2015) collected by authors of the Washington Post. The psychological insight into such a metric may allow data to be utilized in anticipation for rowdy crowds and susceptible environments.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

All exploratory data analysis and overall analysis within this project was constructed, reformatted, and coded within notebooks found [within this repository folder.](https://github.com/ubco-W2022T1-cosc301/project-group03/tree/main/notebooks) The project was constructed based upon metrics asking:
1. How likely is it for a certain matchday (gameweek) or time to be a predictor of a rowdy crowd? 

AND

2. Is committing crimes correlated with specific stadiums and/or teams? (Geographical/team-cultural influence)

Our EDA presented intriguing measures and details regarding the dataset. One such metric looked at sorting pertaining to the dataset by observing the average number of arrests for the first 100 datapoints. 
![Figure 1. Average number of arrests during the week for first 100 datapoints](https://github.com/ubco-W2022T1-cosc301/project-group03/blob/main/images/EDA1analysis3.png) 

Since there was no saturday games listed as seen in the figure, we were aware that sorting was done by days of the week and required reformatting to account for Saturday games. This meant reformatting of the dataset sorting was necessary (in our case, by season and THEN day of week). We also sorted data to remove all NaN values by converting them to 0.

There also was lots of variation within the the first 50 points in the database for total arrests when observed histographically above. We could already see some trends arising before with lower arrests during weeks 4-5, 8, and 10-12.

Lastly, when looking at the dataset for overall histographical data of for all categorical datapoints, we notice that arrests predictably have the most common value of 0 (no arrests! üëç)

Overall arrests also interestingly remain very consistent across the years/seasons.

## Question 2 + Results

##### Author: Sarim Faheem 

##### Question: How likely is it for a certain matchday (game-week) or time to be a predictor of a rowdy crowd?

For this research question, once the dataset was sorted and reformatted (accounting arrests for only day, time, week, and season), I theorized that crowds are emotionally influenced by time and place which leads to emotionally charged individuals behaving with conduct that ultimately leads to other erratic individuals joining in. 
![Figure 4. Total number of games during  gameweeks for corresponding gametime](images\\fig3_analysis3.png)
Notice that most games occur at noon which must be accounted for in our remaining results.
![Figure 5. Total number of arrests during  gameweeks for corresponding gametime](images\\fig1_analysis3.png)
**To start with I observed how many arrests take place during specific times and found that most arrests happen at noon (12:00-1:00pm) which makes sense since that is when most games are played** 
![Figure 6. Average number of arrests during  gameweeks for corresponding gametime](images\\fig2_analysis3.png)
However, the average number of arrests was higher during late-night games with expected rowdier crowds.

![Figure 8. Average number of arrests during  gameday](images\\fig5_analysis3.png)
![Figure 9. Total number of games during  gameday](images\\fig6_analysis3.png)


Similar results applied for gamedays where predictably significant amount of games being played on Sunday and therefore, a high amount of total arrests.

Average number of arrests per day is significantly higher on Wednesday as it accounts for only 1 variable within the dataset. (An intense rivalry game on opening day within the 2012 season).

Most notably, Monday night football brings in rowdier crowds on average. Perhaps an indicator of crowd fatigue at the start of of a week.

![Figure 12. Total number of games during  gameweek](images\\fig9_analysis3.png)

For gameweeks, beyond the early week excitement, week number does not seem to have any correlation with arrest rates during NFL games.

- Week 8-9 is scheduled for around November 1 which is the official trade deadline for the NFL. An important variable in sportsfans' perception of the state of their aligned team.
- Week 14-16 is during the late December holidays season.

## Conclusion

Arrests during the NFL season do tend to have a correlation with the influence of groupthink. The team with the highest arrests rate when they are playing on their home field is the San Diego (LA Chargers). Meanwhile the team with the highest arrests during the games where they are playing on the opponents field is the New England (Patriots).

Similarly, arrests during NFL in-season games do tend to have correlation with factors pertaining to time A. There seems to be a distinct correlation of higher arrests per game for late night games compared to the more popularly schedule mid-day early games. Similarly, arrest rates are higher for Sunday-Monday scheduled NFL games compared to remaining game days. 

**Crowds are impacted by multiple factors that influence their psyche and cause their emotional response to be charged or unpredictable. Environment factors such as *time and locale* influence these emotional responses and lead to a desire for some method of discharge. When one individual entices the crowd, the overall crowd seems to jump in to release their emotions. Rowdier crowds for teams with merits, reputations, or high expectations, have higher fan arrests on average similar to  games with rowdier crowds produced from influences of time and season. These factors highlight potential red-flags to predict disorderly fan behavior**
