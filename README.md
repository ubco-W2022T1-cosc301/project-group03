This project was initially drafted with the goal of utilizing the dynamics of psychology to interpret the psychosocial behaviors seen within various sports. The goal was to qualitatively analyze behaviors, cultures, or traditions within sports as a measure to interpret some of the constructs of sports patriotism. Within the NFL, the influence of fan culture is prevalent within college and national football teams as mascots, traditions, and fan participation are distinctly characterized as a symbol of team brand. Despite the comradery, sportsmanship, and goodwill encouraged by international sports committees, NFL matchdays are known to have instances of fans becoming violent (Gambrell, 2015). With a dataset that highlights arrests made during NFL matchdays (2011-2015), we can interpret the demographic of NFL team fanbases, matchday team performance, and stadium atmospheres to understand how psychological concepts such as groupthink, frustration from losing, or enemy complex may influence a fanâ€™s disorderly conduct.

The dataset utilized for this analysis was initially recorded within police records and consists of quantitative information that was requested by Kent Babb and Steven Rich of the Washington Post regarding arrest records for spectators and fans at NFL stadiums. Data was made available for all teams except for Cleveland and New Orleans who refused to participate. Beyond this, parking lot arrests and corresponding data was made unavailable by Detroit, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. Buffalo, Miami, and Oakland provided partial arrest data figures only. The data spans across the 2011-2015 NFL seasons and includes various variables regarding the settings where arrests took place. This includes the number of arrests that took place during the game, the season or corresponding year that the game took place in, the time that arrests took place at, the teams playing during the game (including which team was home or away), the final score line, and attributed data for whether the games were played in overtime or against division teams (added rivalry).
